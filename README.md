# Dragon Mounts: SoW Edition

**Special Version Notice: This mod is for my modpack, so do not ask for following stuffs: support other MC version,
integrations with other mods except mods in modpack.**

*"A Minecraft mod that allows you to breed dragon eggs and foster them to ridable dragons." --BarracudaATA*

This mod is an unofficial fork of
[Dragon Mounts: Legacy](https://github.com/MWall541/Dragon-Mounts-Legacy)([CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/dragon-mounts-legacy)|[Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/dragon-mounts-legacy)),
for Fabric 1.20.1.

Since this mod is used for my Songs of War RPG modpack, so this mod won't port to other Minecraft version unless the
modpack update.

## Features
- Make dragon eggs hatchable.
- 8 types of dragons, also tameable!
- Data driven system to make your own dragons.
- Dragon breath and multiple riders support.

## Special Thanks
- BarracudaATA: Original project.
